# ES6-Node-REACT-BOILERPLATE

First of all run this command:
```
  npm i
```
This is a node react boilerplate that uses ES6 on the backend. So you basically use ES6 features with Node.Js.

Commands to run :
```
npm run dev
```

This will run both backend server and frontend server within one shell.

For Backend Only:
```
npm run server
```

For Frontend Only:
```
npm run client
```

Customize the package.json to meet your requirements.

### Frontend runs at port 3000
### Backend runs at port 8080
